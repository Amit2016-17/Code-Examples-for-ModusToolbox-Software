# Code Examples for ModusToolbox Software

There are hundreds of code examples available - so many we can't put them all in one repository. Go to the individual repo to get the code, or to learn more about each repo.

## Code Examples for ModusToolbox Software 

| Repo | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
|[PSoC 6 SDK Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Code-Examples-for-the-ModusToolbox-PSoC-6-SDK) | Demonstrate the peripherals and basic functionality of the PSoC® 6 MCU. Some examples demonstrate more complex solutions.|
|[AWS IoT Greengrass Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/AWS_IoT_Greengrass_Code_Examples)|Amazon Web Services Greengrass examples, both publisher and subscriber |
|[AWS IoT Publish/Subscribe Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/AWS_IoT_Publish_Subscribe_Code_Examples)| Amazon Web Services cloud-based examples|
|[20819A1 Bluetooth Examples](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Code-Examples-BT-20819A1-1.0-for-ModusToolbox-1.1)| Demo applications and snippets for CYBT-213043-MESH and CYW920819EVB-02, along with an empty application template|
|[Mbed OS and CapSense](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-CapSense)| Shows how to integrate Cypress CapSense technology into an Mbed OS 5 application|

The AWS examples rely on the [AWS IoT Client Library](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/AWS_IoT_Client_Library). The examples will link that library automatically.

You can find Cypress-specific examples for Arm Mbed OS by searching this site for "mbed-os-example". For example that search would find: [mbed-os-example-CapSense](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-CapSense).
